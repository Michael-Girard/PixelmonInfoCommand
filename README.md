# PixelmonInfoCommand
Command for displaying pixelmon information in chat.

Known Issues:
1)Minecraft with the pixelmon mod must be run once without the command jar in the mods folder. This is to have the pixelmon mod create BetterSpawnerConfig.json in Minecraft's config folder. If BetterSpawnerConfig.json does not exist, the mod will throw an error during minecraft's startup and the game will not start.
