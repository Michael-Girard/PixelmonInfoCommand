1.0: First release
1.1: Implemented tab auto-completion for Pixelmon. Previously, pressing tab while typing in the command caused minecraft to crash.
1.11: Removed /spawn alias. It was overriding a server-side command to warp back to the server's spawn point.
1.12: Fixed MimeJr information display. Because the code achieved case-insensitivity by capitalizing the first letter of the pokemon's name and lowercasing the rest, it was searching for "Mimejr" when the J in Jr needed to be capitalized.
1.2: 
  1) Rewrote a significant amount of the code. Separated biome-related operations into their own class, json parsing operations into their own class, and the pixelmon class is now separate instead of an inner class of the command. Cleaned up the code that parsed the spawn json files a bit and added more comments. Making Pixelmon into its own class should make it easier to develop additional functionality to display pixelmon item drops.
  2) The mod no longer has the minecraft directory hardcoded. Instead, it uses a property to get the location of minecraft game and adds on folders after that. Hopefully this makes it compatible with Technic.
1.21: The mod no longer crashes when it can't find or open the BetterSpawnerConfig or the Pixelmon jar file. Instead, the mod continues. When the command is used or attempts to autocomplete, it attempts to load the BetterSpawnerConfig or Pixelmon file again. If it continues to fail, it displays an error message in chat.
